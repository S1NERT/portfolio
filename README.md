## Requirements

Svelte 4 requires `Node 16` or higher. The project is currently developed and deployed with `Node 18.17.1`.

I also recommend using [corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) to enforce the pnpm version. You can set it up on your system with `corepack enable`.

## Development

```zsh
gh repo clone S1NERT/portfolio
pnpm i
pnpm dev --open
```
